                <p>South Ferry is probably the most pristine subway station in New York City. The tunnel’s walls are made of glossy white tiles, and the quartz columns are edged with steel. It’s symmetrical, futuristic, and illuminated with LEDs. It smells fresh. The speckled subway floor glistens.</p>

A century ago, aboveground entrances could be found across the early subway system—if you take the 1 train to 72nd Street, you’ll exit through a kiosk similar to the one that used to stand at 116th Street.
